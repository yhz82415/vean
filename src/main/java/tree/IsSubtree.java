/**
 * Check if a binary tree is subtree of another binary tree
 * Given two binary trees, check if the first tree is subtree of the second one. A subtree of a tree T
 * is a tree S consisting of a node in T and all of its descendants in T.
 * The subtree corresponding to the root node is the entire tree; the subtree corresponding to any other node
 * is called a proper subtree.

 For example, in the following case, tree S is a subtree of tree T.
